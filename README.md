# Portfolio
Portfolio for Ki

Currently, the portfolio is not yet ready.
I really do not like how the current theme is building; main index is built, but it doesnt look like a good design, particularly left side.
For now I have combined main index with sources from past practice portfolios, and main index is not responsive as well.
I will probably completely overhaul sometime soon to look better.
